CS 499 – Refinement Plan
Dimitri Atalla

Software Engineering --
	I believe that the skills I’ve learned over the past two years within SNHU’s Software Engineering program has helped prepare me for this course. 
  I believe that thanks to this knowledge, I’ve been able to successfully improve within my position at my job while also improving as a student. 
  So, for this segment, based on the knowledge that I currently have, I believe what I will do is create a Web Based system that will utilize a database 
  that utilizes either SQL or Mongo. I believe, the best type of language to use would be either Java or Python. Ideally, I’d be able to piece together 
  a desktop function that will then save and obtain information from a backup. 
 

Data Structures and Algorithms --
	Considering how major this topic is, the first ideal approach to this would creating something along the lines of a Search Engine where the function 
  will be dependent on the user input. Then once the user makes an input, they will then be processed using possible DFS or BFS in order to obtain the 
  information. I believe that creating something like this will help establish understanding in both linear and binary searches while also being able to 
  apply the ideology to the real-life situations. I think my experience at SNHU also supports this proposal as I’ve been able to learn about binary and 
  linear algorithms that allow one to search. 
 

Databases --
Lastly, something that I have quite a bit of experience in, is the database element of this project. While studying, I’ve been able to learn MySQL, 
and Mongo. These courses involved a myriad of teachings such as creating databases, pipelines, queries, etc. which has been amazing for my career. 
In order to properly reflect my teaching, I believe I can create a database that will be utilized by the application piece mentioned above. This would 
act as a record management system that utilizes CRUD. 
 

ePortfolio Overall --
In hopes of successfully completing the course, I believe that ideally, I will be able to evaluate code properly. When reviewing I would hope 
to be able to identify blocks of code that may potentially be able to be simplified while also identifying potential areas of improvement. Also, 
within this portfolio, my goal is to attempt to write out my narratives to provide a clear view into my thought process, explaining why I did things 
and why I didn’t do certain things. Lastly, in terms of the professional self-assessment, I would like to believe that I have a strong visual as to 
where I want to end up in terms of my career, and how I can get there. I would hope that this professional statement is going to be able to display 
this approach, explain how I can obtain my goal, while also displaying how the skills I’ve learned will translate to my future career plans.
